        <h2>About My Cooking Journey</h2>
        <p>
            As a proud Nepali, I have a deep love for our traditional cuisine. I enjoy preparing and savoring dishes like dal bhat, momo, and many more. The rich flavors and unique spices in Nepali food are a testament to our culture and heritage.

        <h2>Starting a Cooking Venture</h2>
        <p>
            I'm excited to share that I've embarked on a culinary adventure with my brother Dhiran and my friend Barsha. Together, we're starting a small cooking business where we'll serve Nepali dishes to our community. We're thrilled to bring the tastes of Nepal to a wider.
