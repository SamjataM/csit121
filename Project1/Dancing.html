        <h2>About Dancing Journey</h2>
        <p>
            Dancing has always been a significant part of my life. As a Nepali, I take pride in performing our cultural dances, which are not only a form of artistic expression but also a way to celebrate our traditions.

        <h2>Dancing at Church</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to cultural dances, I'm actively involved in dancing at my church. It's a spiritual and emotional experience that allows me to connect with my faith and the community.
