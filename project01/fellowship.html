        <h2>About Our Fellowship</h2>
        <p>
            At our Nepali speaking church in Baltimore, our fellowship activities are a beautiful union of faith. We come together to worship God, grow spiritually, and connect on a profound level, blending our traditional Nepali values with Christian beliefs. In our gatherings, we engage in heartfelt prayers, sing hymns and choruses, and receive insightful biblical teachings from our pastors. other side, we do lot of enjoyable activities at Youth Fellowship, Sunday School, Mother's Fellowahip. We cook, eat, play game, dance, and sing.
