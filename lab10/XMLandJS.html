    <h1>Understanding XML and JavaScript</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>What is XML?</h2>
        <p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) was made by the W3C to help share information on the internet in a structured way. It's like a set of rules for writing down data so that computers can easily understand and exchange it. Unlike HTML, which is mainly for showing things on a web page, XML focuses on describing and organizing data. It doesn't replace HTML but works alongside it. For example, XML developers can make their own tags to organize and explain their data, making it more flexible and powerful for different uses on the web.</p>

        <h2>How is XML used?</h2>
        <p>XML is often used to show structured data in a hierarchy and is widely employed in web development for storing data, configuring files, and exchanging information between various systems.</p>

        <h2>What does XML look like? (Example)</h2>
        <pre>
            <person>
                <name>Samjata Mangar</name>
                <age>21</age>
                <address>
                    <city>Baltimore</city>
                    <zipcode>12137</zipcode>
                </address>

        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a web browser language that makes websites interactive and fun by handling elements like forms and images. Unlike regular languages, the browser understands and uses it instantly, allowing developers to create dynamic and interesting websites. It is often employed alongside HTML and CSS.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</h2>
        <p>HTML gives structure to web pages, CSS styles them, and JavaScript makes them interactive. These three, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, are essential for creating modern websites with dynamic and appealing features.<p>

        <h2>Common JavaScript Elements, Properties, Methods, and Functions</h2>
        <p>Elements in JavaScript often refer to parts of the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of an HTML document.</p> 
        <p><strong>Element:</strong> document.getElementById('myElement')</p>
        <p>Properties are characteristics or attributes of objects.</p>
        <p><strong>Property:</strong> element.innerHTML</p>
        <p>Methods are functions associated with objects.</p>
        <p><strong>Method:</strong> array.push('newItem')</p>
        <p>Functions are blocks of reusable code.</p>
        <p><strong>Function:</strong> function myFunction() { /* code here */ }</p>
